# Drink Friend App Starter for Vaadin 10
:coffee::tea::sake::baby_bottle::beer::cocktail::tropical_drink::wine_glass:

This is a Vaadin 10 Flow example Java application, used to demonstrate features of the Vaadin Flow Java framework. Non-PolymerTemplates fork of [github.com/vaadin/beverage-starter-flow/](github.com/vaadin/beverage-starter-flow/).

The Starter demonstrates the core Vaadin Flow concepts:
* Building UIs in Java with Components based on [Vaadin components](https://vaadin.com/components/browse), such as `TextField`, `Button`, `ComboBox`, `DatePicker`, `VerticalLayout` and `Grid` (see `CategoriesList`)
* [Creating forms with `Binder`](https://github.com/vaadin/free-starter-flow/blob/master/documentation/using-binder-in-review-editor-dialog.asciidoc) (`ReviewEditorDialog`)
* Making reusable Components on server side with `Composite` (`AbstractEditorDialog`)
* [Creating Navigation with the Router API](https://github.com/vaadin/free-starter-flow/blob/master/documentation/using-annotation-based-router-api.asciidoc) (`MainLayout`, `ReviewsList`, `CategoriesList`)
